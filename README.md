## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning with ResNet-50 to classify images of flowers. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our own models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of various types of flowers. The sample image shown above is an example of a daisy flower. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Model

We use ResNet-50, a powerful convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. By fine-tuning this model on our flower dataset, we can achieve high accuracy in flower classification with reduced training time.

## Files
